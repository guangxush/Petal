 * You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.
 * <p>
 * Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
 * <p>
 * Note: Given n will be a positive integer.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: 2
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
 * 1. 1 step + 1 step
 * 2. 2 steps
 * Example 2:
